# QuoteBot

* Rely on an API | Compilation of quotes I've collected over time/years
* Randomly choose one
* Post quote at a specific time everyday for users on my discord server

Quotes should be inspirational/uplifting/philosophical/ect
The quotes will be "Food for thought" themed.
Your brain eats too, make sure you feed it the good stuff!

Estimated time to complete:
- Writing code: maybe 10 mins
- Quote API/Compilation: who knows? maybe OCR on my images will work.
